<h2>MY EXPERIENCE!</h2>
<p><b><font face="tahoma">I would like to share my experience during online classes at home as a student. Like the previous semester, I am still studying online at home. 
I'm sure all of students have same experienced like connection issues, same goes with me. I also have a connection problem 
where i have to face a slow line connection. What can be say is line connection problem becomes one of the issue 
especially during attending online class. I had once a problem with slow connection when i was attended online class.
This disorder caused me to be unclear about the lecturer teaching on the google meet platform and this became a problem as it made 
me missed important things or topics that I should learned and understood. It would takes time to ensure line connection is stable and 
running smoothly.But when I had faced this problem, what I need to do is ensure my line connection being well before class started and 
if the problem occurs again, I will refer or ask my fellows friends about the topic studied or I will find the solution to ensure 
my networking is stable.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="tahoma">However,even during online classes, I can create good memory or create the happiness time with my classmates. 
For example, when i do my assignments even though individual or in grouping, I will do some discussion with them just like asking thier opinion, 
examples and solutions. I am so grateful for having them because they always helping me in completed the task and also gave me a well responded. 
Although now we are doing online classes but it does not mean can affect our relationship but it gives more affects on our social time. 
This is because, we are having online classes using platform like google meet or zoom which allow us for chatting, vidoe conference, sharing information, 
do discussion and do well collaboration with each other that make improvement in our socialization.</font></b></p>

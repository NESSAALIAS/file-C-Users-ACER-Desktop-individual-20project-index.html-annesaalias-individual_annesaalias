<p><b><font face="tahoma">I started my primary school at Sekolah Kebangsaan Alor Janggus until I continued my 
secondary school at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Alor Janggus. These both of schools are close with my home and 
of course from there I gained a lot of sweet memories especially with my classmates and teachers. They are truly superb and the best!. 
After I finished my school, I continued my studies at UiTM Kedah branch on 2019 as Diploma of Information Management student. 
Same goes with my other friends which some of them futher their studies at other universities. Became as Information Management student 
I got a lot of information and knowledge which I learned something new that I did not know. 
So, because I'm the only one in my family who continue studying at UiTM Kedah,I'm very grateful 
and I will do my best and study well.</font></b></p>
